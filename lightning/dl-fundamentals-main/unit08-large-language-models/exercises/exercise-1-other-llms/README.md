# Exercise 1: Trying Other LLMs



In Unit 8.7, we finetuned a DistilBERT model and got ~86% accuracy when finetuning only the last layers. In fact, there are many other LLMs that can even get you better performance. For this exercise, experiment with different LLMs for text classification from [here](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification).

I'd also be curious to hear about your findings! Finetuning the last layers of a different model, I got 94.9% test accuracy for example. What was your best model? Please feel free to share your results [here](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/dl-fundamentals/discussions/41).
